    https://stock-screening-tool-coral.vercel.app/

In this app there is a checkbox which shows the data of last month but we don't have the data of stock on month wise so I just added it just in UI with no functionality for that.
Same goes for save the Query button    

I have assumed that users will provide input when compoaring for marketCap in crores like 100cr, 1000cr,200000cr

## Usage 

To use the My Stock Screening Tool, follow these steps:

1. **Input Market Cap**: Enter the query in the provided input fields. Ensure that the input is in the correct format to get accurate results.

2. **Checkbox for Last Month's Data**: There is a checkbox available in the UI that allows you to view data from the last month. Please note that while this checkbox is present, the functionality to fetch month-wise data is not implemented cause provided doesntot have date in it. It is only for display purposes.

3. **Save Query Button**: After entering your criteria, you can use the "Save Query" button. Similar to the checkbox, this button is included in the UI, but it does not currently perform any action. It is a placeholder for potential future functionality.

4. **View Results**: Once you have entered your data and made your selections, you can view the results displayed on the screen. The app is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for stock screening based on the inputs provided.

5. **Explore the Deployed Application**: You can also explore the live version of the application at the following link: [Stock Screening Tool](https://stock-screening-tool-coral.vercel.app/).

Feel free to test the application and provide feedback or suggestions for improvements!
